            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Cry of the Dead Whale" was designed to highlight the harmful and deadly effects of plastic 
            pollution on sea creatures. It aimed to shock people and make them realize the severity of the problem.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The centerpiece of the installation was a life-sized sculpture of a dead whale, measuring a 
            staggering 78 feet long! The whale was made entirely of plastic waste that had been recovered from the ocean. This 
            included things like single-use grocery bags, water bottles, cups, straws, and even ghost fishing gear.  What made 
            this installation even more impactful was that the whale was depicted as pregnant, with a dead baby whale inside. 
            This was a particularly poignant detail, symbolizing the future generations that will suffer the consequences of 
            our plastic consumption.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Cry of the Dead Whale" served as a stark visual reminder of the massive amounts of plastic 
            waste that end up in our oceans. It brought attention to the fact that the Philippines is one of the world's largest 
            contributors to plastic pollution. The installation aimed to spark conversations about what can be done to address this 
            issue, encouraging individuals, corporations, and governments to take action.

            <b>EXHIBITIONS:</b> <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The installation was displayed on the front lawn of the CCP in Manila. This prominent location 
            ensured that it would be seen by a large number of people. It was unveiled in April 2019, coinciding with Earth Day 
            celebrations, which further emphasized its environmental message.
